# Install AWF (Agentic Workflow Firewall) binary with SHA256 checksum verification
# Usage: install_awf_binary.sh VERSION
#
# This script downloads the AWF binary directly from GitHub releases and verifies
# its SHA256 checksum before installation to protect against supply chain attacks.
#
# Arguments:
#   VERSION - AWF version to install (e.g., v0.10.0)
#
# Security features:
#   - Downloads binary directly from GitHub releases
#   - Verifies SHA256 checksum against official checksums.txt
#   - Fails fast if checksum verification fails
#   - Eliminates trust dependency on installer scripts
